## Imagine...
---

Imagine a whole number greater than 9.
Let's say it has three digits a, b and c like "123",
where **a = 1**, **b = 2** and **c = 3**...

## Sum Digits...
---

Sum the digits from your numbers: **a + b + c**.

For our example _[123]_ : _1 + 2 + 3 = 6_

## Subtract...
---

Subtract the digit sum from the original number: **abc - (a + b + c)**

For our example _[123]_ : _123 - (1 + 2 + 3) = 117_

## Remember...
---

Remember this last result

**abc - (a + b + c)**

_(117 in this example)_
